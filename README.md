Blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Multiplexing: One of the most significant differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is that HTTP/2 allows for multiple requests and responses to be sent and received simultaneously over a single connection. This is known as multiplexing, and it significantly reduces latency and improves performance.

Binary protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which is more efficient than the text-based protocol used by HTTP/1.1. This allows for better compression, faster parsing, and fewer errors.

Header compression: HTTP/2 includes a new header compression algorithm that significantly reduces the size of headers sent between the client and server, resulting in faster page load times.

Server push: HTTP/2 allows servers to push resources to clients before the client requests them, improving performance by reducing the number of requests needed to load a page.

Stream prioritization: HTTP/2 allows for the prioritization of individual streams, enabling more important resources to be loaded first and improving the user experience.



Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript



In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
